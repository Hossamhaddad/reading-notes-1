**ORDER OF EXECUTION**
 
*We have to arrange order, like if we run function and inside the function there is an global var we have declare this variable*

*before run the function*

**EXECUTION CONTEXT :**

1.Global Context

2.Eval Context (not shown)

3.Global Scope

**The Stack** *when function need data from another function.*	

**For New Execution there are two phases of activity :**

- prepare : create variable,arguments and  functions , calling function and assign value  before declare.

-execute : assign value to variable ,run function and execute statement.  

*each execution holds the variables, functions, and parameters available within it.*

*interptor looke for execution and fixed the code.*

*Error object help you to fin mistakes and a browser help you to read it.*


*the browser help you to know what your code error like a chrom :*

-SyntaxErr or : Expected token ' ) '  **for missing closing bracket**

-SyntaxError: Expected token ']'  **for missing comma in array**

-ReferenceError: Can ' t find vari able: xyz  **xyz variable not declared**

-etc..


**HOW TO DEAL WITH ERRORS**

1.DEBUG THE SCRIPT TO FIX ERRORS

2.HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY

**debugging is to identify where is the proplem and what it is**


**Developer Tools in browsers help you to know where is the error and show you the corrupted command line**

*there is vary way for each browser to reach Developer tools*

**logging data to the console in many methods like console.info(),console.warn,console.log(),etc..**

*console. assert() condition method for console*

**BREAKPOINTS** *used to pause execution in specific point*

**STEPPING THROUGH CODE** *if there is multiple breackpoint you can step through them by tools like (pause,step into ,step out,etc..)

*you can add condition to breackpoint if condition met the execute weill breack*

*handling exeption by try , catch and finally*

*NAN (not a number) if you use string value to mathematical operation it fixed by using Parseint()*
