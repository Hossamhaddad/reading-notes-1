The DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using a DOM tree.

With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page get El ement Byld (),getElementsByClassName().

JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page.

JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes removeChild().

JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attribut creatElement().

thereis many way to select elements using DOM 


i used loop to remove all child from my lab

while (myobj.firstChild) {

myobj.removeChild(myobj.firstChild);

}


and we can use for loop like 

var obj=document.querySelectorAl('.nameOfClass)

for(var x =0;x<obj.length;x++){

obj[x].textcontent="what you want";



}





**parent** is used to refer to the direct parent of a given element.

**first Child** refer to first item of li.

**last Child** refer to last item of li.

**previousSibling** property returns the previous node of the specified node, in the same tree level.node.previousSibling.

**nextSibling** property returns the node following the specified node, in the same tree level.node.nextSibling.

**textContent** refer to text of element like <p>textcontent<p>.

**innertext** like the textcontent but innertext is aware of the rendered appearance of text, while textContent is not.


**innerHTML** there are security risks associated with using innerHTML. can be used on any element node. it used both to retrieve and replace 

content.

**DOM Manipulation** easily targets individual nodes in the DOM tree.it can be safer than ussing innerHTML

**innerHTML**The innerHTML property sets or returns the HTML content (inner HTML) of an element. obj.innerHTML for return property

obj.innerHTML = "Anything" for set property



ADDING ELEMENTS USING DOM MANIPULATION :

1.CREATE THE ELEMENT createEl ement ()

2.GIVE IT CONTENT createTextNode()

3.ADD IT TO THE DOM appendChild() 

REMOVING ELEMENTS VIA DOM MANIPULATION :

1. STORE THE ELEMENT TO BE REMOVED IN A VARIABLE

2. STORE THE PARENT OF THAT ELEMENT IN A VARIABLE 

3. REMOVE THE ELEMENT FROM ITS CONTA INING ELEMENT

document.write()

The document object's write () method is a simple way to add content that was not in the original source code to the page, but its use is rarely 

advised.


adv of innnerHTML :

- You can use it to add a lot of new markup using less code than DOM manipulation methods.

- It can be faster than DOM manipulation when adding a lot of new elements to a web page.

- It is a simple way to remove all of the content from one element (by assigning it a blank string)

adv of Manipulation :

-It is suited to changing one element from a DOM fragment where there are many siblings.

- It does not affect event handlers.

- It easily allows a script to add elements incrementally (when you do not want to alter a lot of code at once).



Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-

side scripts into web pages viewed by other users

DEFENDING AGAINST CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING :

-VALIDATE INPUT GOING TO THE SERVER
  
  -Only let visitors input the kind of characters they need to when supplying information. This is known as validation. Do not allow untrusted 
  
  users to submit HTML markup or JavaScript. 
  
  -Double-check validation on the server before displaying user content/storing it in a database. This is important because users could bypass 
  
  validation in the browser by turning JavaScript off. 
  
  -The database may safely contain markup and script from trusted sources (e.g., your content management system). This is because it does not try 
  
  to process the code; it just stores it.  
  
  -As your data leaves the database, all potentially dangerous characters should be escaped (see p231). 
  
  -Make sure that you are only inserting content generated by users into certain parts of the template files (see p230).   
  
  -Do not create DOM fragments containing HTML from untrusted sources. It should only be added as text once it has been escaped. 
 
XSS: VALIDATION & TEMPLATES:

Make sure that your users can only input characters they need to use and limit where this content will be shown on the page. 

XSS: ESCAPING & CONTROLLING MARKUP :

Any content generated by users that contain characters that are used in code should be escaped on the server. You must control any markup added to 

the page. 

**Attribute**

*getAttribute() method returns the value of the attribute with the specified name, of an element.*

*hasAttribute() method returns true if the specified attribute exists, otherwise it returns false.*

*removeAttribute() method removes the specified attribute from an element.*

*setAttribute() method adds the specified attribute to an element, and gives it the specified value.*
