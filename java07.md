JavaScript can make webpages more interactive :
1. access content
2. modify content
3. program rules
4. react events

The ABC of programing :
A :- What is a script and how do i creat one?
B :- How do computers fit in with the world around them?
C :- How do I write a script for a web page?

                 (A)
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal,
Like a browser rendering web page depend on a script.

Writing a script :
1- **DEFINE THE GOAL:** *Before write script you have to state  goal of script.*
2- **DESIGN THE SCRIPT :** *To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks and represent it using a flowchart*
3- **CODE EACH STEP:** *A programming language that a computer understands must be written.*

Computers solve problems programmatically; they
follow series of instructions, one after another.

DEFINING A GOAL &
DESIGNING THE SCRIPT :
*firstly,you should to identify your goal for the script then break it into a series of tasks that have to be
performed in order to achieve the goals.*

**EXPRESSIONS**
There are two types of expressions :
*1. Expressions that just  assingn a value to a variable.*
*2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.*

Description of  **operators**.
The + symbol its only operator for string variable it use to join the strings on either side of it. 

**Function**
*A function is a collection of code that returns a value.*
When you ask it its known as **calling the function.**
Some functions need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task thats information  known as **parameters**.
The result from function its known as a **return value**.
A function not run without **called** it.

**Declaring a function**
*creat a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.*
*puted  an example for declaring a function*.
