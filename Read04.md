< a href = "google.com" > Click Here < / a >
for link to other page we can use element < a > and href attribute for hyperlink . 
we can link to other pages by using < a > in li or type many  < a > elements in different place in the same site.

**Directory Structure**
*It is a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder.*
*Folders are referred to as directories on websites.*
 
**Relative URLs**
*using URL to reach file*

*mailto: inside href make the user open email program or app"

*The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.*
*_blank	Opens the linked document in a new window or tab

*You can use href="#top" or href="#" to link to the top of the current page or using id #*

**Chapter 15**
*CSS make HTML elements in boxes , the boxes will be block or inline .*
*Controlling in position using CSS by many ways :*
-Normal flow *position:static*
-Relative Positioning*position:relative*
-Absolute positioning*position:absolute*
-Fixed Positioning*position:fixed*
-Overlapping Elements *z-index*
-Float *float:right or left*
-Clear *clear: left or right or none or both*

*box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottomand left or right it should be placed.*

**Screen Sizes**
*screen sizes different from device to another and resolution same, we can face this proplem in many ways*
-Fixed Width Layouts *do not affect from user screensize.width: 400px*
-Liquid Layouts *stretch and contract as the user screen size* width: 90%*
-layout Grid  *grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.*

**CSS Frameworks**
*providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms.to shorten the time and effort*

**JS**
**Function**
*A function is a collection of code that returns a value.*
When you ask it its known as **calling the function.**
Some functions need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task thats information  known as **parameters**.
The result from function its known as a **return value**.
A function not run without **called** it.
we can put multiple value in a single function.

**Declaring a function**
*create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.*
*to call function we need call a name of function so we must give it a name.*
*myfun is a name of function it can be like this function myfun() or var myfun=function()*

**Variable Scope**
-Local Variables *Variables that are declared inside a function or block*
-Global Variables *Global variables are defined outside of function*

*Global Variables The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded* **thats lead to consume more memory**
*Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.*

**pair programing**
*pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation“two heads are better than one”*
pair programming commonly involves two roles 
-the Driver *who is typing a code* 
-the Navigator *uses their words to guide the Driver*
6 reason for pair programing :
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
