Chapter 1 :
**Structuring Word Documents**

*The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of
information , Structuring Word Documents make a document easier to understand.*

**HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages.**

*The HTML Element:is everything from the start tag(<) to the end tag(>).*

Examples of some HTML elements has an opening tag and a closing tag

1.< h1 >words< / h1 >

2.< p >words< /p >

3.< bod >contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs,etc.</body>

4.< html >HTML code< /html >

5.< head >contains information about the page</head>

6.< title >defines the document title that is shown in a browser title bar or a page tab.</title>

7.< main >< /main >(from 102)

8.< header >< /header >(from 102)

9.< footer >< /footer >(from 102)

**Attributes:** *provide additional information about elements,usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".*
*Example : Color,Background-Color,Float,href,alt,etc.(from 102)*
*Web Page can be creating by text editor like (notepad,notepad++,etc) on Microsoft and (textedit) on MAC.*

HTML layouts are a great way to create order in any web site. 
These elements allow us to arrange the content of the site as smoothly as possible and add style to any desired HTML container with specific HTML contacts for headers, articles and footers.

This makes easier to manage, style, and manipulate.
Difrencces between <header> and <footer>.
Definition and Usage of (<nav>,<aside>,<section>,<hgroup>,<figure>and(<a> with attribute href))

Chapter 18 :
Knowing who is being targeted to visit the site and why they visit the site through specific questions.
Site Maps:its a diagrame  show the structure of your site, its sections and the links between them,
Sitemaps make navigating your site easier.
WireFrames use to plan a websites structure and experiment with ideas before moving on coding.
And from my own experience, I feel that the wireframe raises creative when designing it.

JavaScript :

JavaScript can make webpages more interactive :
1. access content
2. modify content
3. program rules
4. react events

The ABC of programing :
A :- What is a script and how do i create one?
B :- How do computers fit in with the world around them?
C :- How do I write a script for a web page?

                 (A)
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal,
Like a browser rendering web page depend on a script.

Writing a script :
1- **DEFINE THE GOAL:** *Before write script you have to state  goal of script.*
2- **DESIGN THE SCRIPT :** *To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks and represent it using a flowchart*
3- **CODE EACH STEP:** *A programming language that a computer understands must be written.*

Computers solve problems programmatically; they
follow series of instructions, one after another.

DEFINING A GOAL &
DESIGNING THE SCRIPT :
*firstly, you should to identify your goal for the script then break it into a series of tasks that have to be
performed in order to achieve the goals.*
Illustration of an example of **flowchart**.

a browser can see a web page in three steps :
1. Recive a page as HTML code
2. Create a model of the page and store it in memor
3. Use a rendering engine to show the page on screen

A browser can translate JavaScript instruction by interpreter( or scripting engine ).

To Create web page we need three languages (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) in order.

HTML for content layer
CSS for presentation layer
JavaScript for behavior layer

Progressive Enhancement its a three aproach to building web page :
First aproach Using just HTML , Second aproach Using HTML and Css, Last aproach using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
