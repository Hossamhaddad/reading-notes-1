It is not always that the members share the same characteristics or the same background, that their work is easier and better, but it may cause problems among the members.

When backgrounds are diversified, ideas come out stronger and more diverse, and there is less disagreement between members

firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers  a practice known as **‘‘employee performance optimization’’** isn’t enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more **team-based**.

Google sought to build an perfect team and thats costed millions of dollars through specific activities that improve job performance.

project Aristotle’s researchers asked about what the characteristic of members can be the best for perfect team and searched about it.

Google’s research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important,except that sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group so its not clear about choosing best behaviour.

Usually teams that succeed every time are always successful and teams that fail one time are always unsuccessful.

For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability.

It is not a requirement that the manager be smarter than the employees or studies, but rather that he has a management talent like Sakaguchi.

They found it easier to speak honestly about the things that had been bothering them, their small frictions and everyday annoyances.‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’

We should not focus only on efficiency but on life at work because the work is more than just labor.

There are small words that can affect the psyche of others and make them feel let down, like a word ‘Ouch!’ to Rozovsky.
