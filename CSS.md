What is **CSS**?
*CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen.
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.*

**CSS** is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

Block & Inline Elements
**Block** *level elements look like they start on a new line.*
**Inline** *elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line.*

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts:
A property and a value, separated by a colon.
You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

**External styles**
*An external stylesheet is a standalone .css file that is linked from a web page. The advantage of external stylesheets is that it can be created once and the rules applied to multiple web pages.*

**Internal styles**
*Holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, but you can configure CSS classes and IDs that can be used to style multiple elements in the page code.*

**Inline styles**
*Relate to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a specific page element. Theyâ€™re useful for quick, permanent changes,
But are less flexible than external and internal stylesheets as each inline style you create must be separately edited should you decide to make a design change.*

**CSS Selectors**
1.Universal Selector *{} .
2.Type Selector Element{} .
3.Class Selector .classname{} .
4.ID Selector #idname{} .
5.Child Selector li>a {} .
